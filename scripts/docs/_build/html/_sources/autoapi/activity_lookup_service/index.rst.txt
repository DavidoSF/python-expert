Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: activity_exists(activity_id: int) -> bool

   Check if an activity exists in admin activities.
   Note: For Ticketmaster activities, they're fetched dynamically,
   so this only checks admin activities for now.


.. py:function:: get_activity_by_id(activity_id: int) -> Optional[app.models.db.activity.Activity]

   Get an activity by ID from admin activities.


.. py:function:: get_all_activity_ids() -> List[int]

   Get all known activity IDs from all sources (Ticketmaster + admin).
   Note: This is a snapshot of currently loaded activities.
   In a real app, you'd query a database.
